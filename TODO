- LargeHashable instances for common Haskell types
- TemplateHaskell for automatically deriving LargeHashable instances
- Support for SHA256 and SHA512, maybe also for more hashing algorithms
- Performance tuning
- Documentation

Minor:
- Find possible memory leaks (due to the newArray maybe?)
- Update benchmark
